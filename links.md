#Links for os212

1. [VirtualBox Walkthrough](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) <br>
VirtualBox is a virtualization product which can be use by enterprise and home user. This links serve as an alternative guide from the VLSM OS website that serves as a virtualization for Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and solaris. This manual interests me as the links provided gave a nice explaination for every step in using the virtualbox.
2. [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) <br>
This Git Command documentation explains a lot of different way to use git. The documents given provides some reference manual, cheat sheets, and video tutorials. The documentation is interesting since it gives comprehensive knowledge towards the platform that we commonly use (github/gitlab).
3. [Basic Linux Command](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands) <br>
The links is an article on 35 of linux basic commands that will most probably be used in this semester. This links is very helpful especially for linux beginner such as myself to have a simple explanation for basics commands available for linux.
4. [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) <br>
Nano is an editor just like vi that is available for UNIX Operating System. Some people like nano better than vi since it is more user friendly as they provide guide icon and less complicated than vi. During the first week, I tried to implement both vi and nano as an editor and for now, nano suits me better than vi.
