# Links for os212

1. [VirtualBox Walkthrough](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) <br>
VirtualBox is a virtualization product which can be use by enterprise and home user. This links serve as an alternative guide from the VLSM OS website that serves as a virtualization for Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and solaris. This manual interests me as the links provided gave a nice explaination for every step in using the virtualbox.
2. [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) <br>
This Git Command documentation explains a lot of different way to use git. The documents given provides some reference manual, cheat sheets, and video tutorials. The documentation is interesting since it gives comprehensive knowledge towards the platform that we commonly use (github/gitlab).
3. [Basic Linux Command](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands) <br>
The links is an article on 35 of linux basic commands that will most probably be used in this semester. This links is very helpful especially for linux beginner such as myself to have a simple explanation for basics commands available for linux.
4. [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) <br>
Nano is an editor just like vi that is available for UNIX Operating System. Some people like nano better than vi since it is more user friendly as they provide guide icon and less complicated than vi. During the first week, I tried to implement both vi and nano as an editor and for now, nano suits me better than vi.
5. [Linux Security](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html) <br>
This website explains briefly about how linux security works and compares on how linux security is better than windows or maxOS security. The link explains how different kind of operating system gives different output of security but somehow got underestimated by enterprises. The article explains that even tho linux is an open source which seems like a scary thing for security, but this allows anyone to review it and make sure there are no bugs or back doors. After i read the article, I personally believe that linux OS have the best security but it requires a power user since it provides less user interface.
6. [How Public Key Encryption Work?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)<br>
This link gives a great explanation about public key encryption and cryptographic key. The link explains about how public key encryption works in a sense that even someone like myself who is new to the concept can understand easily with a real-life examples. This link also explains how TLS/SSL are related to public key in which they use public key encryption as a secure communication over the internet.
7. [OS Security](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
Through a simple display of the website, this link explain how operating system security method works in detail, from encryption techniques to real-world applications. The appearance of the website looks simple but the content iteslf is very useful especially for someone who is new to how operating system security works. This website gives me a deeper understanding towards security as how important security can be (They also briefly explains how stack and buffer overflow works in C program which is related to C programming that is used for this weeks topics).
8. [Learn C programming](https://www.learn-c.org/)<br>
Learning C programming for me is a bit different compare to other languages that I've learned such as python or java. Even tho they both have similarities in programming language, C-language for me feels like a combination of python and java language where it has a simple syntax like python but does not read per line. The web itself gives a glimpse of how C-language works that is closely related to the way machines work. The website includes an interactive terminal which gives me better curiosity on how a mix-and-match code that I created in the web gives a slightly different output.
